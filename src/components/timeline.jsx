                        <p>Coursework included software engineering, data structures and algorithms, robotics, RTOS and embedded systems. When completing an undergrad, all students are required to work on a year-long capstone project. All the projects are presented at the end of the year durring our design expo. My partner and I won Best of Show for 2019! We created a parking monitoring system that overlooked a nearby parking lot and determined which spots were avaialable and displayed that information in our app. </p>
